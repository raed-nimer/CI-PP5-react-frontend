## Agile development

Link to my [GitHub Agile Project](https://github.com/users/raed-nimer/projects/4)

I felt more confident implementing the Agile methodology since I had experience with it from the last project. I decided to use Kanban and the MOSCOW prioritization method for this project.

Epics and User stories helped me organize the project better. And it can be even more efficient when used within a team. I will continue using this methodology for my future projects, considering it very helpful. I will also start exploring Jira, which is also considered a good agile and project management tool.

I created four columns: Backlog, In Progress, In review, and Done. I also created 9 labels:

For MoSCoW prioritization: Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have

5 helper labels: bug, Epic, documentation, enhancement, User-story

I created 7 Epics, divided into 12 user stories. Epics and User Stories are connected with the # link on the title and in the description.

| Example    | Image                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Epic       | ![Epic](public/readme-images/epic-img.png)     |
| User story | ![User story](public/readme-images/user-story-img.png) |

My Kanban board:

| At the start                                                | Current status                                                    |
